# About

This is the file structure I use organize r code without creating one big messy file. It is not designed to be a package for distribution so it is fragile. Everything should work of used as intended. 

It assumes that the following libraries are installed:
* tidyverse
* cowplot
* rethinking
* ggrepel

Scripts are run using RStudio with the working directory set to the folder containing all of the r scripts.
